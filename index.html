          <p>Surprisingly, the Wedding Cake strain doesn‚Äôt really taste like wedding cake, but rather earth like and sour. Only towards the end do you get a slight hint of sugary sweetness. But despite its deceiving name, the Wedding Cake strain is super potent, with THC levels around 27%, and can induce a calming and happy high that uplifts and rejuvenates. It can also help with nerves pains of all sorts.</p>

          <h2>Sativa vs. Indica vs. Hybrid</h2>
          <p>Sativa and Indica are the two main species of cannabis, which have thousands of subspecies, or strains.  Sativa contain more THC than CBD/CBN, While Indicas contain more CBD/CBN than THC.  THC, CBD, and CBN are all cannabinoids, the beneficial compounds in marijuana that produce the medical and psychoactive effects.   Each strain has its own effect, such as Double Dog, a Sativa which can relieve symptoms for depression, ADHD, and PTSD, or Blue Chip Girl Scout Cookies, an Indica which relieves stress, pain, and insomnia.  Customers can easily use online resources, or consult with you our Purple Lotus budtender to find out whether sativa or indica strains suits them the best.</p><br>
          <p>Hybrid strains are the best of both worlds for many customers.  Hybrid strains are a cross of two or more strains of cannabis, allowing the customer to get the desired effects of both Indica and sativa strains in one hybrid strain.  For example, let‚Äôs say a customer has arthritis pain but needs to medicate before work each day.  A hybrid strain would allow him to reap the benefits of Indica‚Äôs pain relief without becoming too drowsy. There is a wide range of cannabis strains in between Indica and Sativa. These strains are known as ‚ÄúHybrids‚Äù and show traits directly related to the genetics in its lineage.</p>

              <p>THCA is the main constituent in raw cannabis. THCA converts to Œî9-THC when burned, vaporized, or heated at a certain temperature.  THCA, CBDA, CBGA, and other acidic cannabinoids hold the most COX-1 and COX-2 inhibition, contributing to cannabis‚Äô anti-inflammatory effects. This cannabinoid also acts as an antiproliferative and antispasmodic.</p>

              <p>The most abundant cannabinoid present in marijuana, THC is responsible for cannabis‚Äô most well known psychoactive effects. THC acts as a partial agonist at the CB1 and CB2 receptors. The compound is a mild analgesic, or painkiller, and cellular research has shown that it has antioxidant activity.</p>

              <p>CBD has tremendous medical potential. This is particularly true when the correct ratio of CBD to THC is applied to treat a particular condition. CBD acts as an antagonist at both the CB1 and CB2 receptors, yet it has a low binding affinity for both. This suggests that CBD‚Äôs mechanism of action is mediated by other receptors in the brain and body. CBD has non-psychoactive effects. </p>

              <p>CBN is a mildly psychoactive cannabinoid that is produced from the degradation of THC. There is usually very little to no CBN in a fresh plant. CBN acts as a weak agonist at both the CB1 and CB2 receptors, with greater affinity for CB2 receptors than CB1. The degradation of THC into CBN is often described as creating a sedative effect, known as a ‚Äúcouch lock.‚Äù</p>

              <p>THCV is a minor cannabinoid found in only some strains of cannabis. The only structural difference between THCV and THC is the presence of a propyl (3 carbon) group, rather than a pentyl (5 carbon) group, on the molecule. Though this variation may seem subtle, it causes THCV to produce very different effects than THC. These effects include a reduction in panic attacks, suppression of appetite, and the promotion of bone growth. THCV acts as an antagonist at the CB1 receptor and a partial agonist at the CB2 receptor.</p>

Although research on CBDV is still in its initial stages, recent studies have shown promise for its use in the management of epilepsy. This is due to its action at TRPV1 receptors and modulation of gene expression.</p>

          <h2>Terpenes</h2>

       	<img src="assets/img/terpwheel.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">

          <p>Terpenes, or isoprenoids, provide cannabis with its unique bouquet. The molecules are quite small and consist of repeating units of a compound called isoprene. Although less well-known than the major cannabinoids, terpenes are instrumental to the physiological and psychoactive effects of cannabis. The relationship between terpenes and cannabinoids, known as the ‚Äúentourage effect,‚Äù ultimately differentiates one strain of cannabis from another.</p><br>
<p>Terpenes play a vital role in the plant kingdom; they deter insect predation, protect plants from environmental stresses, and act as building blocks for more complex molecules, such as cannabinoids. Many terpenes act synergistically with other varieties of terpenes, and some either catalyze or inhibit formation of different compounds within a plant. Understanding how terpenes function allows scientists to manipulate cannabinoids to desired ratios.

          <h2>Edibles</h2>


          <p> 
With all the options available to medical/recreational customers today, many are choosing to explore methods of medicating beyond the traditional pipe or paper. Marijuana infused products, commonly referred to as edibles, provide another option to customers who cannot, or choose not to smoke their cannabis. Edibles come in many different varieties including brownies, candy, chocolate bars, cookies, drinks, capsules, snacks and more.</p> <br> <p> 
Cannabis consumed orally enters the blood stream after being digested or broken down in the stomach and is absorbed in the intestines. Eating infused products is a healthier alternative to inhaling cannabis smoke because there is no exposure to carbon, tar, carcinogens, etc‚Ä¶ <br>
</p>
<p>
Some customers, such as those on supplemental oxygen, turn to cannabis infused edibles <b>when smoking is no longer an option</b>. For customers with eating and digestive disorders, edibles testing high in cannabidiol (CBD) are not only a great source of nausea-reducing medicine, but also a vital source of essential nutrients and calories. The same is true for cancer patients suffering from nausea caused by their treatments, and customers dealing with hyperemesis (morning sickness). Additionally, many choose edibles as their preferred method of consumption because it‚Äôs a more discreet way to medicate, while others simply prefer the longevity of effects when ingesting cannabis compared to the fast-acting effects of smoking. 
</p>
<p>
First-time customers here at PLPC should typically start with a low dose of 5-10mg active cannabinoids (THC, CBD, etc.). However, only you can determine what dosage works best for you. This often requires experimenting with different potencies and types of edibles. It‚Äôs going to be a learning process through trial and error. Recommend to your customer to keep a journal and record of their experiences with different products, dosages, and try to distinguish what ratio of cannabinoids in what dosage yields the maximum therapeutic effect for their specific ailment / health condition needs.

          <p>Though there are untold varieties of edibles available on the market today, infused edibles can all be split into three basic categories: those geared towards gastrointestinal uptake (digested through stomach), those geared towards oral uptake (through saliva), and a few that fit into a hybrid category that targets both.</p><br>

              <h4><a href="">Gastrointestinal uptake</a></h4>
              <p>The most common edibles are geared towards gastrointestinal absorption. Any edible where the cannabinoids are absorbed through the stomach falls into this category; this includes brownies, cookies, sour, capsules, gummies and many more food types. These edibles tend to take longer to activate within the body (sometimes as long as two hours), but produce a longer-lasting effect (up to eight hours of relief).</p><br>

      <h3>The Effects of Edibles</h3>
     <p> Because most edibles are exposed to some kind of heat during the cooking process, many of the inactive cannabinoids such as THCA and CBDA, are converted to THC, CBD, and CBN. <em> This heating process, known as decarboxylation, </em> as well as the high levels of THC found in edibles, work together to create an ideal treatment for many disorders / health conditions including chronic pain, muscle inflammation and spasms, autoimmune disorders, nervous system disorders, insomnia, and nausea ‚Äî provided the patient is well enough to ingest the medication. The acid forms of THC and CBD (eg. THCA and CBDA) are highly beneficial and provide their own medicinal benefits, so finding infused edible products that are not completely decarboxylated is preferred.</p><br>

     <p>
While anyone can enjoy the benefits of edibles, patients suffering from Crohn‚Äôs Disease, an autoimmune disorder of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract that affects as many as 700,000 Americans, find this method of medicating extremely beneficial. This is because Crohn‚Äôs Disease occurs in the GI tract, precisely where edibles distribute useful active and inactive cannabinoids at the root of the problem. Ingesting cannabis will affect you different than smoking the plant. However, exactly what effect edibles will have on you depends on several factors: the type and potency of the edibles you are using, your tolerance, your body chemistry, and even how much you‚Äôve had to eat. Because the effects of eating an edible differ greatly from the effects of smoking, many first time users are caught off guard by the stronger potency and long-lasting effects.</p><br>

<p>
Despite CBD‚Äôs anxiety-relieving properties, many people experience a heightened sense of anxiety and paranoia when they initially ingest an edible. This is caused by various factors, but tends to mostly deal with fact that most people are not used to ingesting cannabis yet and have feelings of uncertainty, which leads to anxiety and paranoia. This seems to fade away the more you eat them, and get used to the effects.</p><br>
When you smoke marijuana you only receive a small amount of the cannabinoids in each draw, although the effects will be felt instantly. This is unlike eating edibles which tend to hit you much more slowly. In fact, edibles take roughly 1-2 hours to reach maximum effect, so be sure to allow adequate time before ingesting more. Eating infused treats tends to release the effects in waves as the cannabinoids are processed by the stomach and digested over a 2-6-hour period.</p><br>

  <h3>Dosing Recommendations</h3>
     <p>When selecting an edible, it is very important to pay attention to the potency of the product you are recommending to the customer. This will help you determine how much of the product you may suggest to eat, as many edibles are designed to be split into multiple doses. However, the exact potency of an edible can be tough for a customer to determine because the strength of an edible depends on the potency of the product used to infuse it.</p><br>

     <p>
‚Äú5-10mg of active cannabinoids is a good starting point for customer that are ingesting cannabis for the first time.‚Äù 20-100mg of active cannabinoids is considered a daily dose by most customer who consume cannabis regularly, although it will vary per individual. Only your customer can determine what dosage works best for them. </p><br>

<p>
At Purple Lotus we offer infused products, that are lab tested, use quality ingredients, and have proper labels on the product‚Äôs packaging (including recommended dosage). Please use the cannabinoid content numbers on the packaging as a rough guideline to determine a preferred dosage recommendation to your customer. </p><br>


<p>As a Purple Lotus budtender it is your job to be educated on the this subject and help customers navigate through our wide selection of cannabis-infused products. You should be happy to give advice on edibles as you interact with a many customers on a daily basis. Converse with other budtenders or management staff to hear feedback from people in similar situations as yourself about our products.</p>

          <h2>Topicals</h2>


          <p> 
Cannabis topicals are great for your skin, but did you know they could also treat burns, alleviate arthritis, and take therapeutic massages to a whole other level? And this barely scratches the surface. Because cannabis topicals are non-psychoactive, they are a versatile way for you to take advantage of those cannabinoids. Available as lotions, balms and sprays, these powerful antidotes offer numerous healing properties.</p> <br> 

<h3>Provide Localized Pain Management</h3>
 <p> 
If customers are suffering from back or knee pain, for example, cannabis topicals could help. Cannabis-infused creams or balms are great for treating pain in a specific area of the body. Better yet, they are also fast-acting. Once applied, the cannabinoids in topicals bind with the CB2 receptors in your skin, providing quick relief. Topical cannabis infusions act on a peripheral basis, which means they do not enter the bloodstream. This translates to zero psychoactivity. So you can apply them liberally without the potential side effects of too much THC.
</p><br>
<h3>Enhance Sexual Pleasure</h3>
<p>
Cannabis topicals are making their way into the bedroom as well. Companies such as FORIA in which we carry has developed cannabis-infused oils and lubricants designed to enhance sexual pleasure. Cannabis is a well-known aphrodisiac, particularly for women.

          <h2>Vaporizer Cartridges</h2>


          <p> 
Cannabis topicals are great for your skin, but did you know they could also treat burns, alleviate arthritis, and take therapeutic massages to a whole other level? And this barely scratches the surface. Because cannabis topicals are non-psychoactive, they are a versatile way for you to take advantage of those cannabinoids. Available as lotions, balms and sprays, these powerful antidotes offer numerous healing properties.</p> <br> 

<h3>Ease of Use</h3>
 <p> 
Deciding to recommend a pre-filled cannabis oil vape cartridge this will take the guesswork completely out of the equation. Contrary to other methods of using hash oil such as a dab rig and nail setup, or even manual portable vape pens which require self-loading, pre-filled ‚Äúcarts‚Äù require little to no effort whatsoever. At most, these products may require you to press a button to inhale. In fact, most of the time you don‚Äôt even have to worry about the battery life many products are designed so that charging the battery isn‚Äôt even necessary on a daily basis.
</p><br>
<h3>Portability </h3>
<p>
Pre-filled oil vape carts are the easiest method of enjoying hash oil while on the go. Their sleek and minimalist design allows for discreet vaping, free of the distracting qualities that larger setups or raw cannabis products may carry (such as noticeable smoke or odor).
</p><br>

<h3>Dosing </h3>
<p>
For uninitiated cannabis concentrate users, dosing can be a major concern. Nobody wants an overwhelming experience when attempting to enjoy cannabis oil products responsibly. Unlike dabbing, using a pre-loaded vape pen allows for a highly controlled dose with each inhalation. This gives the user full autonomy of how much or little to consume. Therefore, such as an edible please advise your customer to start off slow and increase. Wait 3-10 mins in order to gage the effects and increase if needed.</p>
<br>

<h3>Cartridge/Battery Combos vs. Disposables</h3>
<p>When choosing a pre-filled vape pen, there are several hardware options. Some products are offered in tanks that typically come formatted with a 510 threaded standard vaporizer battery insert. These tanks can fit on any battery that contains the 510 threading, and nowadays almost all battery tanks come in this format that we sell at Purple Lotus. The exception to this is when you purchase pre-loaded tanks designed by companies to fit their personalized batteries. An example would be the PAX Era Pods, which are designed to be used with their vaporizer/battery systems. Please be aware not all draw style batteries will work with all cart, offer our Spinner adjustable/push button batteries. Alternatively, we offer VVS ‚Äúdisposables,‚Äù containing a pre-charged battery designed to support the device until the tank empties. These pen varieties require no charging and are meant to be disposed of after use. They contain no threading and are not meant to be separated from their battery.
Temperature settings ‚Äì some require low heat or high heat most batteries with a push button, will have this option. Depending on which brand / quality and viscosity of the oil.

          <h2>What CBD:THC Tincture Ratio Should You Recommend?</h2>


          <p> 
There's no single ratio that's right for everyone or every condition. You'll want to find the balance of CBD and THC that works for your customer. A person's sensitivity to THC is a key factor in finding the right ratio and dosage. So please recall on asking your open ended question ‚ÄúWhat would you like to see improved?‚Äù Many people like the cannabis high, yet others find THC unpleasant. CBD can lessen the mind-altering effects of THC, so, a greater ratio of CBD-to-THC (18:1) means less of a high. Purple Lotus Patient Center offers several ratios of CBD:THC so you can adjust or eliminate psychoactive effects as your customer may prefer. Some patterns are beginning to emerge. You may want to remember this for anxiety, depression, spasms, psychosis, and seizure disorders, research reports they do best with little THC. For cancer, autism, and other diseases, some patients say they  may benefit more from a balanced ratio of CBD and THC like the 4:1 or 2:1. Extensive clinical trials conducted outside the United States have shown that a 1:1 CBD:THC ratio can be effective for neuropathic pain. We highly advise to use cannabis products with different CBD:THC ratios at different times of the day, using for example more CBD in the day, more THC at night so please pay attention of your customer‚Äôs needs.

</p> <br> 

<h3>DOES IT MATTER IF CBD IS EXTRACTED FROM CANNABIS OR INDUSTRIAL HEMP?</h3>
 <p> 
<em>Yes, it matters.</em> You may encounter a customer stating that their CBD:THC tincture in which they purchased online was ineffective and would like to know why. We recommend CBD-rich products made using only organic, whole plant cannabis because this offers the best safety profile and superior medicinal benefits. CBD products derived from industrial hemp may have several potential problems: <em>Industrial hemp typically contains far less cannabidiol than CBD-rich cannabis strains</em>, so a huge amount of industrial hemp is required to extract a small amount of CBD. This raises the risk of contaminants as hemp is a ‚Äúbio-accumulator,‚Äù meaning the plant naturally draws toxins from the soil. Hemp-derived CBD and refined ‚Äòpure‚Äô CBD powder <em>lack critical medicinal terpenes and secondary cannabinoids found in cannabis oil</em>. These compounds interact with CBD and THC to enhance their medicinal benefits. Many conditions and situations may require a 1:1 CBD/THC ratio (or some other ratio) and hemp doesn't provide this as an option. We feel that cannabis derived CBD medicine gives the full spectrum of options for patients, contains beneficial terpenes, and utilizes the plant (cannabis) for its intended purpose.

            <p class="font-bold">
                 
Also known as ‚Äúdry sift‚Äù hash, kief is the simplest of concentrates. Kief is composed of the trichomes (the crystalline structures coating the outside surface of the flowers) broken away from the dried plant material, usually via specialized filtering screens and a little elbow grease. Kief is generally considered a lower-quality extract, but some top-flight extractors can produce an extremely clean and flavorful product using this method. THC content can range from 20 percent to 60 percent.

Rosin is extracted from either dried buds, trim, or lower-grade water hash/kief. When the material is smashed and heated quickly between the parchment sheets, it extrudes some of the essential oils present in the plant, resulting in a golden shatter or oil-like extract that looks similar to pressed high-quality water hash or even solvent-extracted shatter. Rosin is still somewhat limited, as is data about its potency; but early reports on some rosin extracts have showed numbers between 50 percent and 70 percent THC, similar to that of high-quality water hash.

Per an interview by Dr. Hayden,  a plant molecular biologist, he wanted to preserve all the biomolecules of cannabis that we enjoy in an extract form. This would be considered a full spectrum extract - an extract containing the full range of potentially therapeutic biomolecules from the cannabis trichrome without the non-therapeutic molecules (waxes, lipids, fats). Therefore, in a full spectrum, extractors like to recover the complete contents of a trichrome. They remove all the undesirables that co-extract during the process by using fundamentals of chemistry.  Instead, of targeting individual cannabinoids, Terp Sauce strives to preserve the entire scope of molecules available in the trichrome. By using HTFSE (High Terpene Full Spectrum Extract) the liquid in this extract would be considered Terp Sauce.

Crumble is a form of BHO (butane hash oil) which is purged for a long time at low temperatures in a vacuum oven, and whipped during the purging period. This gives it a softer consistency, yet allows it to remain brittle enough to crumble in your hand. Like other cannabis concentrates, crumble is much more potent than flower, kief or hash.

A CO<sub>2</sub> oil syringe is a clean, dab-able product once removed from the extraction machine with no harmful residuals or risk of toxicity. Another upside to CO<sub>2</sub> extractions is that it kills any mold or bacteria present in the plant material. Supercritical or subcritical carbon dioxide extractions involve holding the CO<sub>2</sub> at high or low pressures, respectively; the process involves extremely expensive extraction machines. The CO<sub>2</sub> passes through the cannabis material and strips the plant of its oils, waxes and other matter. By adjusting certain parameters, the extractor can save more cannabinoids and terpenes in order to preserve purity or strip more unessential material like chlorophylls.

Hash is one of the oldest cannabis extracts known to humans. You can make hash using several different techniques. The most common process to make solventless hash is to use ice water to separate the trichomes from the plant matter since the trichomes contain most of the essential oils. When separated, they stick together and after they are dry, they are pressed and the hash is ready!

            <p class="font-bold">
                 
The term full melt, or full melt bubble hash, refers to a type of cannabis hash which vaporizes leaving no residue (i.e. 100% effective vaporization). It is a cannabis resin concentrate that is usually obtained via an ice and water extraction method. However, full melt hash can also be extracted using a dry shift process. Both extraction processes are solvent-less and readily separate the cannabis plant‚Äôs resin heads from the plant‚Äôs material.

The goal in creating full melt bubble hash is to obtain the plant‚Äôs pure trichrome heads. The bubble hash is usually called full melt because it is highly concentrated. The cannabis concentrate readily melts and bubbles when heated from flame or vaporization.

Sugar wax can develop naturally over time as the lipids in the wax begin to breakdown and separate from the cannabinoids, which causes the wax to crystalize. It can also result from condensation or other contaminants which get mixed in with the wax, or if the wax is overly agitated during production. Sugar wax is a marijuana concentrate with a full flavor and a slightly grainy texture. It's a little less messy than some of the other types of concentrates as it's a bit thicker and not quite as sticky. Many people prefer sugar wax for its richer, more complex flavor profile.

Shatter is one of the most common concentrates for dabbing. It‚Äôs also one of the purest and most potent extractions. In order to make shatter, cannabis materials go through a double extraction. This removes a large majority of the fats and other plant particles from the oil. The end result is a glass-like sheet of hardened cannabis resin. The overall consistency is similar to hard candy. Shatter can contain up to 80% THC, making it one of the most potent cannabis concentrates around. Yet, while this stuff is very psychoactive, it is also less flavorful than other concentrates. Shatter can be a little difficult to work with, especially as it ages
